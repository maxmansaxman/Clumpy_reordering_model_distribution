Instructions for using reordering model:
1. Keep the two python files in the same folder. Your T-t path files need not be.
2. For best results, your file path should have folder names without spaces.
3. Run the 'General_reordering_model.py' script
4. Requirements: the anaconda python distribution of python3 has all the packages and dependencies you'll need. Free to download, at: https://www.anaconda.com/download/
5. It's all still in development! Email max.k.lloyd@gmail.com with any questions or suggestions. 
6. The dolomite reordering parameters are part of a paper that is in review at GCA (as of 4/26/18). Stay tuned for a citation and please cite accordingly.
7. The template for T-t paths is just a suggestion. Only the first two columns matter.
