# ClumpyCool
## _a flexible program for modeling solid-state reordering of carbonate clumped isotopes_
### Installation instructions
1. Requirements: the Anaconda python distribution of python3 has all the packages and dependencies you'll need. Get it [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Make sure to download & install python 3.x!
2. Keep the two python files (.py) in the same folder. Your T-t path files need not be.
3. We recommend ensuring all folder names in your file path have __no spaces__
4. Run the 'General_reordering_model.py' script in Terminal (Mac), the Anaconda Command Prompt (Mac & PC), or Spyder (Mac & PC)
5. Import your T-t path using the included template as a guide. Only the first two columns of the spreadsheet will be read by the script.
6. Dolomite reordering parameters are from Lloyd et al., GCA, (2018). Calcite reordering parameters are from Passey & Henkes (2012) (For the Passey first order approximation model), and a new fit to the Stolper & Eiler (2015) optical calcite data in the interlaboratory absolute reference frame using the Schauble + Bonifacie CDES25â€“temperature calibration. Please cite accordingly. As of 2/19/2019, the 're-fit' Stolper & Eiler (2015) data are unpublished but with a manuscript in the works.
7. It's all still in development! Email max.k.lloyd@gmail.com with any questions or suggestions, or major bugs & instabilities you find.
